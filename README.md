# 🐍 Python Practice Daily

## 📘 About This Repository
This repository documents my **daily Python problem-solving and learning journey**.  
Each notebook or `.py` file represents one focused practice session — ranging from beginner topics (loops, lists, functions) to data analysis, algorithms, and eventually machine learning.

I treat this as a **public learning log**: every day I solve problems, debug mistakes, and reflect on what I learned.

- Each **day folder** contains my work for that day.  
- Some notebooks include **errors and debugging notes** — because learning from mistakes is part of the process.  
- Over time, new folders will appear as I explore more Python and ML concepts.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy
1. **Solve → Reflect → Upload**  
   - Attempt problems independently first.  
   - Then review, refactor, and document the lessons learned.  
   - Push at least one notebook or file daily to GitHub.
2. **Keep Errors Visible**  
   - Instead of deleting failed attempts, I add short Markdown notes explaining what went wrong and how I fixed it.

## 🧭 Long-Term Goal
To build strong programming fundamentals and **gradually transition into data science and machine learning projects**, while maintaining **daily coding discipline**.
